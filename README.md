## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Users should be able to navigate using the keyboards (e.g. tabs)

The challenges I face at the begining was, figuring out the spacing and how to structure that in the html

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I've learn how to add accessibility such as knowing which element (preferably HTML5) to use for the right context

- Learned how to implement aria-label
- Learned, you can either use "a" or "button" tags for users to navigate with their keyboard
- Lastly, I've learned to solely use the correct HTML5 for the right content

### Continued development

- I want to continue implementing the WCAG (a11y) and understanding it further
